# Timeseries_ML_B-L475E-IOT_LoRa
Testing Machine Learning algorithm port on B-L475E-IOT card and data transmission using LoRaWAN

This project aims to document the procedure we had to perform in order to embark ML models on STM32 Discovery Kits (B-L475E-IOT01A2)

Should you wish to try the project from scratch, you can follow the method detailed [here](building_lora_project/README.md).

If you are lost after building your first project, you can find informatione [here](building_lora_project/README.md).

If you wish to start directly with Tensorflow Lite, without the EdgeImpulse SDK, you can find information on building a project here.
